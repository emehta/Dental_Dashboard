Okay, so you have my code for dashboard 1. I will give you the three data sets, or so dashboard 1 is using PATAP data, it's using that. I now have three additional data sets that I will give you, and I want to now start thinking about and making my second dashboard, which is going to be operations related. Everything operations for, you know, that a CFO would like to see, or an operations specialist would like to see of a dental multi-site healthcare like clinic business. So look at it, take a look at it, analyze everything, and then tell me what dashboard views, analytics, filters, you could come up with. And obviously we can use the data set that is being used by dashboard 1 too, or we could keep it completely separate, or, you know, we could run calculations across the two. So have a look, and just tell me what you're thinking. Dont give me No code, no CSV files, nothing.
